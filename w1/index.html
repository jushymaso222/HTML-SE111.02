        <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
        <p>I am a software engineer in my second quarter at <strong>New England Institute of Technology</strong> in Rhode Island. I am 20 years old and have been in college for the past 3 years. I started off by going to college at the <em>University of Rhode Island</em> for two years under mechanical engineering. About two semesters and a half in, I lost interest in being there. All of the classes were packed with kids, there was no 1 on 1 time with the professor, or hands on learning. <u>It felt very distant</u> from the students and I was not enjoying my time there any longer. So, I moved to New England Tech with a new major, software engineering.</p>
