            <p>Pacific Rim will forever hold a spot in my list of top movies. Depending on the type of films you are into, you’ll either really love it or hate it. Pacific Rim is a very cliché action movie with a sci-fi twist. Back in the day, this movie was one of the top sci-fi movies ranking as the top 6 most popular movie in the year 2013. Sounds great, right? Well, yes if you like sci-fi and action it is a phenomenal movie. The storyline is amazing, the concept is extremely interesting, and the action is packed. </p>

            <p>Those who will dislike it will be those who find action movies such as these to be repetitive and dull. Nowadays, we have sci-fi movies everywhere and almost all of them are action movies or horror, so I understand if the genre has become bland. However, this was a relatively fresh new territory as a movie concept at the time (not the action sci-fi part, just the movie concept in general). </p>

            <p>I personally loved the movie. Coming from an engineering background, I’ve always been fascinated with sci-fi books, movies, shows, etc. The idea that giant aliens, called “Kaiju’s,” would be appearing from an interdimensional portal underwater, sounds ridiculous out loud but is just plain cool in my opinion. One of my favorite concepts from the movie is the requirement of two pilots per Jaeger, or robot, in order to control. I think the idea of a mind-link to connect the two pilots’ movements together is extremely interesting and it partially makes sense. In the movie, they give the reasoning that the controls of the Jaegers are too complex and numerous for one pilot to manage. We do see it is possible for someone to pilot a Jaeger solo, especially the smaller ones, but it takes a huge toll on the operator’s mind and should only be done in edge cases.</p>

                <h3>Trivia</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Approximately a hundred Kaijus and a hundred Jaegers were designed, but only a fraction of them appeared in the film. Every week, the filmmakers held a vote for their favorites.</li>
                    <li>(At around 1 hour, 25 minutes) The inside of the building that Gipsy's fist smashes through was created using miniatures. Many of the components of the office cubicles were made using 3-D printers. The lighting was practical and done to scale. Once the set was ready, a large green mandrel was rammed through it. This was digitally replaced with Gipsy's fist.</li>
                    <li>Screenwriter Travis Beacham also wrote the graphic novel Pacific Rim: Tales from Year Zero. Released along with the movie, "Tales from Year Zero" serves as a prologue to the film and is set twelve years before its events.</li>
                    <li>Though the giant monsters were always intended to be computer generated, all of their designs were expanded from the notion that they could be "worn as suits," like in traditional kaiju films.</li>
                    <li>According to Travis Beacham, in an earlier version of the script Mako and Raleigh spoke two different languages for a majority of the film. After connecting as pilots, they slowly began to understand one another, and before the end they heard each other speaking in their own respective languages. The only remnant of a language barrier is when Raleigh speaks to Mako in Japanese, and she is surprised he knows her home language.</li>
