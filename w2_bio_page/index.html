        <p class="centertext">Hi, my name is Joshua! I am a software engineer and an avid video game enthusiast. I am 20 years old and have lived in Warwick, RI my whole life. I originally wanted to become an aerospace engineer, focusing on the field of space travel, but have since decided to alter my path and become a software engineer instead. I originally got into software from <em>Minecraft</em> in a mod called ComputerCraft. The mod allows you to make your own programs in LUA and since there were so many possibilities for it within the game, it quickly became my jumping off point for computer science.</p>
